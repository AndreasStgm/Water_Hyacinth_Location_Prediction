# Overview

This is the backend part of our system to predict the location of the Water Hyacinth mat on lakes.

For the satellite imagery it uses images from the [Waterweeds Watcher](https://davidkinsler123.users.earthengine.app/view/macrophyte-monitoring-tool) developed by Rhodes University and Centre for Biological Control.

Weather data is not yet used.
